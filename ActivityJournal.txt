Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name:Devin Rhodie

================================================================
process_word
Start
Estimated Time	6 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	-Plan to use linked_list_functions
	-write code following step by step instructions
	-complile and fix errors
	-debug the rest of the errors
Complete
Actual Time	10 MM
Observations: This part took me some time to understand due to not understanding the
use of this function for MLK. Once I figured it out I wrote it but kept getting errors such as 
getting a 0 for a test in empty list when it should have been 1.
I learned to be consistent and keep in mind all cases of  all the functions related
to the developing code.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
get_first_word
Start
Estimated Time	10 30
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	04 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
At first I was using pointers wrong so I looked at examples and 
realized that I was using them wrong. Once I fixed that the rest
of the function was easy.

================================================================
get_next_word
Start
Estimated Time	10 20
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	10 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I was getting test 20 and 21 wrong repeatedly. After trying to debug 
this function for a long time I realized I had to update the current 
pointer in both this function and the get first word function.

================================================================
get_last_word
Start
Estimated Time	10 00
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

This was done by following the instructions and I did had a segmentaiton 
falut with the core being dumpted but i fixed it.

================================================================
get_prev_word
Start
Estimated Time	10 25
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

This also was pretty straight-forward. I was confused about whether
the current should point to the previous or the next but it worked 
out fine when I used previous.

================================================================
read_file through test 56
Start
Estimated Time	10 30
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

For this I had to look up how to handle file creation
and manipulation. I also used isalpha which helped a lot and saved
extra tests.

================================================================
read_file MLK_dream_excerpt only
Start
Estimated Time	10 45
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	10 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
For this one I went over slides and previous code.

================================================================
write_unique_word_list_to_csv_file
Start
Estimated Time	11 30
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I needed to look up file-writing in C. And I got an error 
of invalid initializer which I could immediately detect came from doing
FILE file instead of FILE *file.

================================================================
Add four unit tests to the unit_tests_student.c file
Start
Estimated Time	4 30
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	5 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I took time to learn how to write tests.
And I had to think of what functions to use.
